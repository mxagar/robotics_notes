# Notes on Robotics

Notes on robotics, mainly (arm) manipulation robotics: kinematics, dynamics, trajectory generation, control. Additionaly robot vision topics are outlined.

I made these notes as a possible script for students.

Some of the used resources:

- [Youtube ThatsEngineering, Robotics Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZaGkBteQK3HQFSWDM7-yRQWTd86DeDIY)
- [QUT Robot Academy, Peter Corke](https://robotacademy.net.au/)
- J. Craig, Introduction to Robotics, 3rd Ed.

Notes done using Notability for iPad.
Examples implemented in Python using Peter Corke's [Robotics Toolbox](https://github.com/petercorke/robotics-toolbox-python).

Index of topics:

1. Spatial Descriptions and Transformation Matrices for Robotic Manipulators (Videos 1, 2, 3; Craig 2)
    - Position vector
    - Orientation/Rotation matrix
    - Frames = Coordinate Systems
    - Transformations
    - Rotation Matrices
    - Compositions of transformations
    - Inverse Transformation matrix
    - Example: Compositions
2. Rotation: Euler Angles & Co. (Videos 4, 5; Craig 2)
    - Fixed Angle representation
    - Euler Angle representation (moving)
    - Comparing rotation representations
    - Example: Find Euler angles
    - Angle-axis representation
    - Unit Quaternions = Euler parameters
    - Ridrigues' Formula

3. Direct Kinematics (Videos 6, 7, 8, 9; Craig 3)
    - Links and joints

4. Inverse Kinematics (Craig 4)
5. Jacobians (Craig 5)
6. Dynamics (Craig 6)
7. Trajectory Generation (Craig 7)
