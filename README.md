# Notes on Robotics

Notes on robotics, mainly (arm) manipulation robotics: kinematics, dynamics, trajectory generation, control. Additionaly robot vision topics are outlined.

I made these notes as a possible script for students.

Some of the used resources:

- [Youtube ThatsEngineering, Robotics Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZaGkBteQK3HQFSWDM7-yRQWTd86DeDIY)
- [QUT Robot Academy, Peter Corke](https://robotacademy.net.au/)
- J. Craig, Introduction to Robotics.

Examples implementes in Python using Peter Corke's [Robotics Toolbox](https://github.com/petercorke/robotics-toolbox-python).
