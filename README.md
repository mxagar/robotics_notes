# Notes on Robotics

Notes on robotics, mainly (arm) manipulation robotics: kinematics, dynamics, trajectory generation, control. Additionaly robot vision topics are outlined.

I made these notes as a possible script for students.

Some of the used resources:

- [Youtube ThatsEngineering, Robotics Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZaGkBteQK3HQFSWDM7-yRQWTd86DeDIY)
- [QUT Robot Academy, Peter Corke](https://robotacademy.net.au/)
- J. Craig, Introduction to Robotics.

Examples implementes in Python using Peter Corke's [Robotics Toolbox](https://github.com/petercorke/robotics-toolbox-python).

Index of topics:
    
1. Spatial Descriptions and Transformation Matrices for Robotic Manipulators (Videos 1, 2, 3; Craig 2)
2. Rotation: Euler Angles & Co. (Videos 4, 5; Craig 2)
3. Direct Kinematics (Craig 3)
4. Inverse Kinematics (Craig 4)
5. Jacobians (Craig 5)
6. Dynamics (Craig 6)
7. Trajectory Generation (Craig 7)
